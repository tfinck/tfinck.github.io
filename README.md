Welcome! I will be doing a webpage remake every few days or so to get better at
front end building. 


Google search results page: This was tougher than I imagined it would be! The 
only things I would change on what I've built so far is the top navigation buttons
should be split into divs. Currently all the navigation buttons are seen as 
display:block, which causes them to behave differently than the google website
but I'll change it later.

Future: No sure, I'll change when I know!
